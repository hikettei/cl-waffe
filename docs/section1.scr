Thank you for having an interest in my framework.

In this section, we define Simple MLP with cl-waffe, and train MNIST.

Let's get started!

@title(Define Your Model)
@cl:with-package[name="cl-waffe"](
@cl:doc(macro defmodel)

The defmodel macro is the most basic unit when defining your network in cl-waffe.

Let's check a example and define 3 layers MLP.

@begin[lang=lisp](code)

; ensure (use-package :cl-waffe) and (use-package :cl-waffe.nn)

(defmodel MLP (activation)
  :parameters ((layer1   (denselayer (* 28 28) 512 T activation))
	       (layer2   (denselayer 512 256 T activation))
	       (layer3   (linearlayer 256 10 T)))
  :forward ((x)
            (call (self layer3)
	          (call (self layer2)
		        (call (self layer1) x)))))

@end[lang=lisp](code)

See :parameters, @cl:param(cl-waffe.nn) exports denselayer and linearlayer which constructor is `(in-features out-features &optional (bias T) (activation :relu))`.

And, when @cl:param(MLP) are inited, layer1~layer3 are initied.


In :forward, this defined the forward props.

You can access your model's parameter through macro (self name).

This is just @cl:spec(slot-value), so it's setfable.

You can call :forward step by using the function (call).

@cl:doc(function call)

Whether you are lisper or not, It is natural that you think MLP's :forward is too rebundant.

So, the macro `(with-calling-layers)` is exported and you can rewrite it.

@cl:doc(macro with-calling-layers)

@cl:param(MLP) requires @cl:param(activation) which indicates the type of activation where @cl:param(activation) is symbol.

Finally, this is how MLP is defined.

@begin[lang=lisp](code)

(defmodel MLP (activation)
  :parameters ((layer1   (denselayer (* 28 28) 512 T activation))
	       (layer2   (denselayer 512 256 T activation))
	       (layer3   (linearlayer 256 10 T)))
  :forward ((x)
	    (with-calling-layers x
	      (layer1 x)
 	      (layer2 x)
	      (layer3 x))))

(setq model (MLP :relu)) ; => [Model: MLP]

@end[lang=lisp](code)
)

@begin(section)
@title(Define Your Dataset)

@cl:with-package[name="cl-waffe"](
@cl:doc(macro defdataset)
)

It is not always necessary to define a Dataset, but it is required to use the trainer described below.

In real, the format of the dataset is similar for different task, so I will use the default dataloader defined in the standard.

@cl:doc(struct WaffeDataset)

Write your own programme to load the study and initialise the Dataloader
